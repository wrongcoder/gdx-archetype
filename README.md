# LibGDX Archetype

This [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) archetype contains my current best practices for [LibGDX](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/) projects. Only desktop and html targets are supported because those are the only ones that I use.

## What is it?

Professional software developers disagree about a lot of things that don't really matter. Very often, all choices are equally valid, but each developer prefers the one they proposed anyway.

In essence, this is my base code for [Ludum Dare](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/). Having a properly working build system right off the bat means I'm not going to spend the first night (or longer) tweaking it to get rid of irritations. Having a bit of a starting point containing a few simple things I'd need to make any sort of game, named and laid out the way I like, is nice as well. On the other hand, having a ton of sample code or features included is not the point of this project.

## What is it not?

It's not a game engine, nor is it an advanced starting point for any particular type of game.

There are lots of excellent game engines out there, some of which are even based on LibGDX. If you're looking for one of those, [Fixel-GDX](https://github.com/flixel-gdx/flixel-gdx) looks pretty good. Check it out.

## A demonstration

* [Run the html target](http://wrongcoder.github.io/gdx-archetype/demo/)
* [Download the desktop target](http://wrongcoder.github.io/gdx-archetype/demo/demo-desktop-1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT.zip)

## Some features

* all: automatically executes TexturePacker2 as part of the generate-resources phase
* all: uses AssetManager and displays a loading screen while update() runs
* all: does not package source files inside the core JAR
* all: only writes generated resources inside target directories
* all: has cleaned up dependencyManagement and pluginManagement blocks
* desktop: includes a JRE re-launcher for JVMs that don't provide a big enough heap
* desktop: produces a ZIP containing a double-clickable JAR and a lib folder -- no more fat-JARs lumping everything together
* desktop: automatically passes the core module through ProGuard
* html: enables SoundMaanager2 click-to-flash support
* html: centres the game in the browser window at start
* html: displays a message if the game seems to be unable to load
* html: enables starting the HTML5 target in a test web server by running one command
* html: drops GAE support stuff (I consider this a feature)

## Quick start

1. Install the archetype

    ```shell
    $ mvn install
    ```

1. Generate a project using the archetype

    ```shell
    $ mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=com.vdxp -DarchetypeArtifactId=gdx-archetype

    [INFO] --- maven-archetype-plugin:2.2:generate (default-cli) @ standalone-pom ---
    [INFO] Generating project in Interactive mode
    [INFO] Archetype [com.vdxp:gdx-archetype:0.9.3.RELEASE] found in catalog local
    [INFO] Using property: groupId = com.example.demo
    [INFO] Using property: artifactId = demo
    [INFO] Using property: version = 1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT
    [INFO] Using property: package = com.example.demo
    [INFO] Using property: projectTitle = Demo Project
    ```

1. Build the generated project

    ```shell
    $ cd demo
    $ mvn -P desktop,html package

    [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    [INFO] Reactor Summary:

    ```

1. Collect the build artifacts
    * `desktop/target/demo-desktop-1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT.zip`
    * `html/target/demo-html-1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT.war`

1. Read the generated [README file](src/main/resources/archetype-resources/README.md) for more information
